# Introduction
 This is the third set of CMSDAS exercises. The purpose of these exercises are for the workshop attendees to become familiar with the basic Grid tools used in CMS for user analysis. Please run and complete each of these exercises. However, unlike the previous sets of exercises, **this set will take considerably longer**. Having your storage space set up may take several days, Grid jobs run with some latency, and there can be problems. You should **set aside about a week** to complete these five exercises. The actual effort required is not the whole week but a few hours (more than the previous two sets). If, at any time problems are encountered with the exercise please e-mail [cmsdas-cern-organizers@cern.ch](mailto:cmsdas-cern-organizers@cern.ch) with a detailed description of your problem. For CRAB questions unrelated to passing these exercises, to send feedback and ask for support in case of CRAB related problems, please consult the [CRAB troubleshooting twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3Troubleshoot). All CRAB users should subscribe to the very useful [hn-cms-computing-tools@cern.ch hypernews forum](mailto:hn-cms-computing-tools@cern.ch).

# Exercise 10 - Verify your grid certificate is OK

This exercise depends on obtaining a grid certificate and VOMS membership, but does not depend on any previous exercises.
After you've installed your grid certificate, you need to verify it has all the information needed.

Login to **lxplus.cern.ch** and initialize your proxy:
```shell
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
```
{: .source}

Then run the following command:
```shell
voms-proxy-info -all | grep -Ei "role|subject"
```
{: .source}

The response should look like this:
```
subject   : /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=vmilosev/CN=757854/CN=Vukasin Milosevic/CN=40175424
subject   : /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=vmilosev/CN=757854/CN=Vukasin Milosevic
attribute : /cms/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL
attribute : /cms/country/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL
attribute : /cms/country/ch/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL
```
{: .output}
If you do not have the first attribute line listed above, you have not completed the VO registration above and you must complete it before continuing.

# Exercise 11 - Obtain a /store/user area and setup CRAB

## Obtain a /store/user area

This exercise depends on **successfully completing Exercise 10**. Completion of this exercise requires a users to have `/store/user/YourCERNUserName` in Tier2 or Tier3 site. (ex, `eos` area at lxplus). and a user should get this automatically once they have a lxplus account.

## CRAB Introduction

In this exercise, you will learn an important tool [CRAB](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCrab), which is used
in all the data analysis at CMS. CRAB (CMS Remote Analysis Builder) is a utility to submit CMSSW jobs to distributed computing resources. By using CRAB you will be able to access CMS data and Monte-Carlo which are distributed to CMS aligned centres worldwide and exploit the CPU and storage resources at CMS aligned centres. You will also test your grid certificate and your cms EOS storage element which will be useful during CMSDAS@CERN{{ site.year }}.

*Help* or *questions* about CRAB: Follow the [FAQ](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCrab#Getting_support) to get help with CRAB.

The most recent CRAB3 tutorial is always in the [WorkBook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook) under [WorkBookCRABTutorial](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookCRAB3Tutorial). This tutorial provides complete instructions for beginner and expert user to use CRAB in their studies. We strongly recommend you to learn the CRAB tutorial after you finish these exercises. In this exercise, you will use CRAB to generate a MC sample yourself and publish it to the DAS.

## Setup CRAB

In this exercise, we will use `CMSSW_13_0_17`.

You can follow the same instructions from [Exercise 3]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-CMSDataAnalysisSchoolPreExerciseFirstSet.md %}#exercise-3---setup-a-cmssw-release-area). The instructions are reproduced here:

```shell
cd ~/YOURWORKINGAREA

export SCRAM_ARCH=el9_amd64_gcc11
### If you are using the default tcsh shell (or csh shell)
setenv SCRAM_ARCH el9_amd64_gcc11
###

cmsrel CMSSW_13_0_17
cd CMSSW_13_0_17/src
cmsenv
git cms-init
```
{: .source}


After setting up the CMSSW environment via `cmsenv`, you'll have access to the latest version of CRAB. It is possible to use CRAB from any directory after setup. One can check that the crab command is indeed available and the version being used by executing:

```shell
which crab
```
{: .source}

```
/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/common/crab
```
{: .output}

or

```shell
crab --version
```
{: .source}

```
CRAB client v3.230404
```
{: .output}

The `/store/user` area is commonly used for output storage from CRAB. When you complete *Exercise 11*, you can follow these instructions to make sure you can read from and write to your space using CRAB command.

Initialize your proxy:

```shell
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
```
{: .source}

Check if you can write to the `/store/user/` area. The crab checkwrite command can be used by a user to check if he/she has write permission in a given CERN eos directory path (by default `/store/user/<HN-username>/`) in a given site. The syntax to be used is:

```shell
crab checkwrite --site= <site-name>
```
{: .source}

For example:

```shell
crab checkwrite --site=T3_CH_CERNBOX
```
{: .source}

 The output should look like this:

{: .solution}

 Choosing the `T3_CH_CERNBOX` "site" allows you to have the option of outputing crab jobs to your *EOS area*, providing you with an easy way to access produced files. However this does not allow for publishing of produced samples as CERNBOX is NOT a CMS storage, and files in there can not be listed in DBS. For more details about crab output options, visit the following [link](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3FAQ).

# Exercise 12 - Generate (and publish) a minimum bias dataset with CRAB

## CMSSW configuration file to generate MC events

 In this section we provide an example of a CMSSW parameter-set configuration file to generate minimum bias events with the Pythia MC generator. We call it `CMSDAS_MC_generation.py`. Using CRAB to generate MC events requires some special settings in the CRAB configuration file, as we will show later.

We use the cmsDriver tool to generate our configuration file:

```shell
cmsDriver.py MinBias_14TeV_pythia8_TuneCP5_cfi  --conditions auto:run3_mc -n 10 --era Run3_2023 --eventcontent FEVTDEBUG --relval 100000,300 -s GEN,SIM --datatier GEN-SIM --beamspot Realistic25ns13p6TeVEarly2023Collision --fileout file:step1.root --no_exec --python_filename CMSDAS_MC_generation.py
```
{: .source}

If successful, `cmsDriver` will return the following
```
We have determined that this is simulation (if not, rerun cmsDriver.py with --data)
Step: GEN Spec:
Loading generator fragment from Configuration.Generator.MinBias_14TeV_pythia8_TuneCP5_cfi
Step: SIM Spec:
Step: ENDJOB Spec:
Config file CMSDAS_MC_generation.py created
```
{: .output}

 Feel free to investigate (look at) the newly outputted
 `CMSDAS_MC_generation.py`.

## Generating MC events locally

We want to test this Configuration file locally for a small number of events before we submit to CRAB for massive generation. To test this file, we can run

```shell
cmsRun CMSDAS_MC_generation.py
```
{: .source}

This MC generation code will then produce an EDM output file called `step1.root` with the content of a GEN-SIM data tier for 10 generated events.

## Generate MC dataset using CRAB

CRAB is handled by a *configuration file*. In CRAB3, the configuration file is in Python language. Here we give an example CRAB configuration file to run the `CMSDAS_MC_generation.py` MC event generation code. You can download a copy of [crabConfig_MC_generation.py]({{ page.root }}{% link code/crabConfig_MC_generation.py %}).

Below you also find the file:

Put the copy of  `crabConfig_MC_generation.py` under `YOURWORKINGAREA/CMSSW_13_0_17/src`.


All available CRAB configuration parameters are defined at [CRAB3ConfigurationFile](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3ConfigurationFile).

Now let us try to submit this job via crab by

```shell
crab submit -c crabConfig_MC_generation.py

For the detail of the crab command, you can find them from [CRABCommands](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookCRAB3Tutorial#CRAB_commands). You will be requested to enter your grid certificate password. <br>
Then you should get an output similar to this:
```
Will use CRAB configuration file crabConfig_MC_generation.py
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:

```
{: .output}

 Now you might notice a directory called `crab_projects` is created under `CMSSW_13_0_17/src/`. *See what is under that directory.* After you submitted the job successfully (give it a few moments), you can check the status of a task by executing the following CRAB command:

 ```shell
 crab status [-t] <CRAB-project-directory>
 ```
 {: .source}
 In our case, we run:

 ```shell
crab status crab_projects/crab_CMSDAS_MC_generation_test0
```
{: .source}

The `crab status` command will produce an output containing the task name, the status of the task as a whole, the details of how many jobs are in which state (submitted, running, transfering, finished, cooloff, etc.) and the location of the CRAB log (`crab.log`) file. It will also print the URLs of two web pages that one can use to monitor the jobs. In summary, it should look something like this:

```

# Exercise 13 - Running on a dataset with CRAB

Now we're going to apply what you've learned using CRAB to the `MiniAOD` exercises you've been working on in the first two sets of exercises. Make sure that you finished and still have the scripts from [Exercise 7]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-CMSDataAnalysisSchoolPreExerciseSecondSet.md %}#exercise-7---slim-miniaod-sample-to-reduce-its-size-by-keeping-only-muon-and-electron-branches) under the `YOURWORKINGAREA/CMSSW_13_0_17/src`.

##  Set up CRAB to run your MiniAOD jobs

If you forget, go back to the `YOURWORKINGAREA/CMSSW_13_0_17/src` and setup crab.

```shell
cmsenv
```
{: .source}

We will make another CRAB config file: `crabConfig_data_slimMiniAOD.py`. Copy it from here: [crabConfig_data_generation.py]({{ page.root }}{% link code/crabConfig_data_generation.py %}) and find it below:

> ## Show/Hide
>
> ```
> from WMCore.Configuration import Configuration
> config = Configuration()
>
> config.section_("General")
> config.General.requestName = 'CMSDAS_Data_analysis_test0'

>
> config.section_("JobType")
> config.JobType.pluginName = 'Analysis'
> config.JobType.psetName = 'slimMiniAOD_data_MuEle_cfg.py'
> config.JobType.allowUndistributedCMSSW = True
>
> config.section_("Data")
> config.Data.inputDataset = '/DoubleMuon/Run2016C-03Feb2017-v1/MINIAOD'
> config.Data.inputDBS = 'global'

> config.Data.unitsPerJob = 50
> config.Data.lumiMask = 'https://cms-service-dqmdc.web.cern.ch/CAF/certification/Collisions16/13TeV/Cert_271036-275783_13TeV_PromptReco_Collisions16_JSON.txt'
> config.Data.runRange = '275776-275782'
>
> config.section_("Site")
> config.Site.storageSite = 'T3_CH_CERNBOX'
> ```
{: .solution}

 Most of this file should be familiar by now, but a few things may be new. The `runRange` parameter is used to further limit your jobs to a range of what is in the `lumiMask` file. This is needed if your two input datasets overlap. That way you can control which events come from which datasets. Instructions how to do this are at [https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmVAnalysisSummaryTable](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmVAnalysisSummaryTable). You can find the year specific instructions by clicking any of the links at the bottom.

## Run CRAB

 Now go through the same process for this config file. You submit it with

 ```shell
 crab submit -c crabConfig_data_slimMiniAOD.py
 ```
 {: .source}

 and check the status with

 ```shell
 crab status
 ```
 {: .source}

 After a while, you should see something like below:

```

## Create reports of data analyzed

Once all jobs are **finished** (see `crab status` above) you can report:

```shell
crab report

{: .source}

You'll get something like this
```
Running crab status first to fetch necessary information.
Will save lumi files into output directory /afs/cern.ch/user/v/vmilosev/CMSDAS2024/Pre-exercises/CMSSW_13_0_17/src/crab_projects/crab_CMSDAS_Data_analysis_test0/results

Use the `FWLiteHistograms` executable you were using in the previous exercises to aggregate the data from all the CRAB output files. The root files created in the above step have been kept at the directory below: `/eos/user/$U/$USER/DoubleMuon/crab_CMSDAS_Data_analysis_test0/` One can use the command:

``` shell
FWLiteHistograms inputFiles=File1,File2,File3,... outputFile=ZPeak_data.root maxEvents=-1 outputEvery=100
```
{: .source}

In my case, `File1=/eos/user/v/vmilosev/DoubleMuon/crab_CMSDAS_Data_analysis_test0/230421_160319/0000/slimMiniAOD_data_MuEle_1.root` etc.. Make sure there is no space in `File1,File2,File3,...`

You may look at `ZPeak_data.root` using `TBrowser`.

# Exercise 14  - Combining the data and calculating luminosity

> ## Note
> This last exercise in this set is done on **lxplus**.
>
{: .callout}

## Install the BRIL Work Suite

We will use the BRIL work suite, a commandline toolkit for CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity to calculate the total luminosity of the data we ran over.

Refer to [the documentation](https://cmslumi.web.cern.ch/) for further information on BRIL.

Enter the following command:

``` shell
/cvmfs/cms-bril.cern.ch/brilconda3/bin/python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade brilws
```
{: .source}

When running `crab report`, the report will give you the location of a **JSON-formatted file** containing the luminosity information
```
Will save lumi files into output directory /afs/cern.ch/user/v/vmilosev/CMSDAS2024/Pre-exercises/CMSSW_13_0_17/src/crab_projects/crab_CMSDAS_Data_analysis_test0/results
```
{: .output}

 This directory contains various luminosity files. Let's figure out how much luminosity was run on by our jobs.

First step is to copy the `processedLumis.json` file to your `.local/bin/` folder:
``` shell
cp [lumi directory]/processedLumis.json ~/.local/bin/
```
{: .source}

Here, `[lumi directory]` is the directory reported by `crab report`.

## Find the luminosity for the dataset

We now let `brilcalc` calculate the luminosity we processed with our jobs using the json file by typing following commands:
``` shell
cd ~/.local/bin/
./brilcalc lumi -b "STABLE BEAMS" --normtag /afs/cern.ch/user/l/lumipro/public/Normtags/normtag_DATACERT.json -i processedLumis.json -u /fb
```
if the above does not work, try instead:
```shell
./brilcalc lumi -b "STABLE BEAMS" --normtag /afs/cern.ch/user/l/lumipro/public/Normtags/normtag_DATACERT.json -i processedLumis.json -c /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/SITECONF/T0_CH_CERN/JobConfig/site-local-config.xml -u /fb
```

 The end of the output should look similar to this (note this example summary is for a different json file):
 ```
 #Summary:
 +-------+------+-------+-------+-------------------+------------------+
 | nfill | nrun | nls   | ncms  | totdelivered(/fb) | totrecorded(/fb) |
 +-------+------+-------+-------+-------------------+------------------+
 | 9     | 37   | 17377 | 17377 | 2.761             | 2.646            |
 +-------+------+-------+-------+-------------------+------------------+
 #Check JSON:
 #(run,ls) in json but not in results: [(275890, 721)]
 ```
 {: .output}

In the example of that other json file, the total recorded luminosity for those CRAB jobs is 2.6 fb<sup>-1</sup>.

> ## Question 14
>  What is the reported number of inverse femtobarns analyzed? (n.b. it is not the same sample as listed above with luminosity 2.6<sup>-1</sup>. )
> For CMSDAS@CERN{{ site.year }} please submit your answers for the [CMSDAS@CERN{{ site.year }} Google Form third set][Set3_form].
