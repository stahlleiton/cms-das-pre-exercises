  CMS is a large collaboration of more than three thousand people, spread over several institutions, across five continents. It is very important to bring the collaborators up to speed, learning about the CMS detector and computing software, in order to contribute to physics data analysis. CMS maintains the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook">WorkBook</a> as much as up-to-date as possible to help guide its users. In addition to it, several <a
      href="https://lpc.fnal.gov/programs/schools-workshops/hats.shtml">tutorials (a.k.a. HATS)</a> and <a href="https://lpc.fnal.gov/programs/schools-workshops/workshops.shtml">workshops</a> are held regularly to give a hands-on experience to the users. There are tutorials covering all aspects of CMS data analysis from reconstructed physics objects (e.g. muons, electrons, photons, jets, etc) to trigger, generators, statistics, machine learning, software development and access to grid and
  computing resources. where one learns the basic CMS software tools. CMS Data Analysis Schools (DASes) offer a boot camp model, concentrating all of the training in a very short period of time. In the beforetimes, DAS used to be in-person and 5 days long, during Covid-19 times it became fully remote, and it expanded into two weeks, with an asynchronous and a synchronous component. The CMSDAS@CERN 2023 resumed the in-person activities that were halted due to the pandemic and the CMSDAS@CERN 2024
  intends to continue to be in-person.

  To prepare CMSDAS participants, a series of pre-exercises are required to be completed, with the laptop that will be used during the school. The goal of the pre-exercises is to make sure all basic issues can be resolved before the actual start of the school so that participants can hit the ground running.

   This instruction page was created by the FNAL team for the purposes of <a href="https://fnallpc.github.io/cms-das-pre-exercises/index.html">CMS DAS@FNALLPC</a> schools. It was modified for the purposes of CMS DAS@CERN 2024 by the local organizing team.
